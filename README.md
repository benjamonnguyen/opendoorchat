# Opendoor.chat
**Client management and chat platform**

## Motivation
Create a seamless chatroom/email integration to provide a better communication experience between vendor and clients.

Allow clients to continue communication via chatroom while maintaining email correspondence for recordkeeping and in cases where a client prefers to opt out.

Chatrooms can provide a better user experience over email threads and make searching for attachments and messages easier.
